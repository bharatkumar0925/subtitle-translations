# subtitle-translations

This repository explores automated subtitle translation from English to Hindi using the pretrained **MarianMT en–hi** model. The aim is to produce accurate, readable, and timing-preserving subtitle files suitable for films, series, educational content, and other media.

The project is currently **experimental**, focusing on testing raw MarianMT outputs, exploring fine-tuning approaches, analyzing subtitle structures, and evaluating methods to keep translations contextually correct and clean. Expect frequent changes as ideas evolve.

This repo contains files related to analysis, fine-tuning experiments, and a CSV dataset that includes aligned English and Hindi subtitle pairs.

In the future, the goal is to build a system where a user can upload an `.srt` or `.ass` file, the   subtitle text is automatically extracted, and a translated version is generated.
